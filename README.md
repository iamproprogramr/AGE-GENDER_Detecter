# Age & Gender Detector

This repository contains a Python script for detecting age and gender from images or webcam feed using OpenCV's deep learning module. The script uses pre-trained models to identify faces and predict age and gender.

## Usage

1. **Running the script with an image**:

    ```bash
    python age&gender_detecter.py --image <path-to-image>
    ```

2. **Running the script with webcam**:

    ```bash
    python age&gender_detecter.py
    ```

## Script Description

- **highlightFace**: This function detects faces in the frame and returns the frame with highlighted faces and the coordinates of the detected faces.
- **Main Script**: The main script initializes the pre-trained models for face detection, age prediction, and gender prediction. It reads the input image or webcam feed, detects faces, and predicts the age and gender for each detected face. The results are displayed in a window with the detected faces highlighted and annotated with the predicted age and gender.

## Example

Running the script with an image:

```bash
python age&gender_detecter.py --image example.jpg
```

Running the script with webcam:

```bash
python age&gender_detecter.py
```
